	<h1>Second Floor</h1>
	<p>Wanda doesn't shave her arms or legs, and wears clothes that are not of quality material. Her roots are showing and her nail polish is always chipping. She does care about the way she looks though. She wears lots of jewelry and always wears makeup when she goes out. She stumbles a lot and has a messy energy. She seems absent, lost, and distracted much of the time, but she is very curious and thoughtful of the world. She is also very honest.</p>
